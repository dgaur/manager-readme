# What is this?
This is my personal implementation of the
["manager readme"](https://managerreadme.com/).
It's basically a cheatsheet for dealing with me.  Like real software,
it's a permanent work in progress and full of defects + inconsistencies.



# My role
I like the model of [servant-leadership](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Servant_leadership).  It's
not necessarily the the best approach in all situations, but I like
those ideas and that framework a lot; and I strive to be that kind of leader.

To that end, I see my role primarily as a facilitator + enabler.
I'm here to help the team and org figure out where to go;
and then remove any roadblocks and obstacles that might prevent us from
realizing those goals. For the same reason, I also try to act as the lightning
rod + general whipping-boy
for our team, in order to shield everyone else from those distractions.

At a high-level, I want our team to be awesome; for everyone on the team to
feel challenged, productive, engaged and happy; and I'm willing to take on the
dreary chores and scutwork to make all that happen.

 

# Communication
- As a general policy: **if you ever have a question, complaint or concern, please just say so**.   Don't suffer in silence.  Don't fail alone.
  *Need help?  Missing a deadline?  Have a better idea?  I'm acting like an idiot?*
  Just say so. In particular, if you're unhappy with me or something I'm doing, please tell me.
- I tend to ask a lot of questions, especially when we're discussing some large
  topic with the team.  *Why do we do XXX?  If we were building YYY from scratch, today, is this the design we would choose?  Can we do this faster/better/simpler?*
  Please don't interpret these questions as
  skepticism or disagreement.  I'm likely trying to (a) confirm my understanding
  or (b) deliberately provoke a longer discussion to find edge-cases and draw out
  other opinions.
- I tend to be a visual learner.  Diagrams and figures help me to understand
  new topics or ideas.  I
  will sometimes start drawing on the whiteboard prematurely as way of
  clarifying/explaining some idea, even to myself.  Or I'll ask: *can you draw me a picture of XXX?*
- I'm more of [think-to-talk](https://www.fastcompany.com/919234/do-you-talk-think-or-think-talk) person, but IMHO talk-to-think is a better mode for team
  discussions and I may deliberately steer debates in that direction.
  I struggle with this sometimes: I want to move quickly, sometimes before
  I've really
  had a chance to internalize some topic, and may circle back after a
  discussion to confirm or discuss in further depth.



# 1:1's
- By default, an hour once a week, until we agree otherwise.  Once we find a
  good cadence, I will try to never cancel
  them.  In the event of an unavoidable conflict, PTO, travel, natural disaster, war, etc, etc, 
  I'll reschedule instead of canceling.
- In general this is **your** meeting to discuss whatever questions or
  concerns you'd like: big strategic topics, small tactical details,
  scary issues, career path,
  technical minutiae, etc.  I will typically bring topics for discussion,
  but will always defer to your agenda over mine.
- If I want to discuss something "big" at a 1:1, like career planning, I'll
  warn you in advance.
  Mostly so you're not blindsided and have time to reflect or review before we meet.
- For urgent tactical issues, please escalate or reach out immediately.  Please don't wait for a 1:1.
 

# Calendar
- My calendar is public by default, with both work- and non-work commitments
  on it.  If my calendar says I'm available, then feel
  free to schedule over it.  Don't wait for an invitation.
- If some topic is urgent or time-sensitive, tell me.  I'll make time
  regardless of what the calendar says.



# Personal values
These topics and expectations are personally important to me; and tend to
color my expectations of the team and the larger org.

- **A bias for action and results**.  When in doubt, let's **act**, not wait.
If we're blocked, I expect us to look for alternative options or other ways
to make progress.  If we're not sure of the path forward, let's gather the best
data we can, make an educated decision, and keep moving.  Corollary:
**Never wait on me**.  If some issue needs
an urgent response or action, make the best decision with the data
we have and then move ahead.  Never wait on me or my input.
- **Quality**.  A high quality bar is important to me personally.  I expect us
to take our internal quality and internal process
seriously; and I prefer fixing issues
over deferring or punting them.  No broken windows.  The hard problems can be fun to fix; but the little ankle-biters are just annoying
and slow us down as a team.  Let's fix those little issues once, not repeatedly.
- **Ownership**.  I expect us to own our own problems + solutions.  If there's
a bug in our code
or one of our components, I expect us to fix it in a timely fashion.  For this
reason, I dislike fuzziness and ambiguity at the edges: if there's a problem
"near" something that we own, I'll assume that it's our responsibility until
proven otherwise.



# Personal quirks and idiosyncrasies
- I routinely work evenings and weekends.  Therefore, I will sometimes
  email/slack/etc you at weird hours of the night, on Sunday afternoons,
  etc.  This is my own personal process: I'm catching up from today; getting
  ahead for tomorrow; or possibly not-sleeping (see below).  Regardless, this is
  **my** process, not yours.  I'm not expecting an immediate response.  Don't
  feel obligated to respond until **your** normal working hours.
- I suffer from raging insomnia, frequently.  Sometimes it's seasonal
  (June, July, August, when there's lots of daylight in this part of the world).
  Other times
  it's self-inflicted (stress, usually).  Regardless, if it's late in the day
  and I seem 
  punchy, disinterested or quieter than usual -- it's nothing
  personal.  Odds are that I'm working on 3-4 hours of sleep, and my caffeine
  has worn off.
